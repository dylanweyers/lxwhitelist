# lx-whitelist
A simple, easy to use job whitelist for Garry's Mod roleplay gamemodes. 
Enables a whitelist system for jobs (teams) in roleplay gamemodes, so that unwhitelisted players cannot access said teams. You can allow players to access individual jobs/teams by whitelisting them in the menu.
There is a small configuration file, however it is a plug-n-play addon, meaning all you have to do to use it is drag the file into your addons directory and restart your server.
